Velocity:  Velocity will be generated by software use (crediting Validators and Redeemers for unit of effort [utility]), as well as by a redemption schema set up by both Sponsors and Redeemers.  Sponsors will be able to use real-world incentives to recapture and redistribute portions of their tokens.  Redeemers will be able to compete in this same marketplace by offering incentives for coin redemption.  Utility credit helps in creating a consensus network and ongoing motivation for all participants.  Redemption pieces offer an evolving valuation based by pressure from varying redemption scenarios.

Burn:  In this scenario, there isn't a concept of 'burn', except by peer consensus to add more tokens into the pool.  Burn is accomplished by tying recirculation into the sponsor/redeemer scenario.  This becomes a self-perpetuating activity where the current pool of incentives and touch-points becomes a determining factor in the valuation of a particular token (along with its utility and public trading pressures).
