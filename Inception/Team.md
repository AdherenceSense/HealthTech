Frederick, Paul, Brad, Ender, and Tim have known and worked with each other for many years, developing software for a variety of industries.  Four of them have several years of working on the same team in a coporate environment; building, maintaining, and innovating in a variety of spaces.  Their combined experience includes data-in-motion analytics with SAIC, adhoc IP provisioning for a national network sweeper, national event coordination and vendor reconciliation, logistics GIS acquisition and analysis for the trucking industry, 3d modeling for the structural engineering arena, and many other verticals/application spaces.

The team has worked through various configurations/methodologies:  agile to waterfall, being geared towards workable tech in the hands of the end users.  To this end, all have been involved in multi-platform developement from mobile to desktop to protocol drivers to web services.  The team's historical deep dives into tech, continued interest in how to leverage upcoming tech for novel and upcoming business ideas, and persistent working together has made them an efficieny and bleeding edge technical team.

To that end, they are committed to embarking on a development path that leverages emerging technologies, including blockchain (and all that entails), graph technology, and solid, dependable UI, in order to make business more efficient, helpful, and profitable.
